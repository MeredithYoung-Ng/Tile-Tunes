# Tile Tunes

Tile Tunes was the name of our robot for a semester long INFO 4320 Rapid Prototyping course project with [Melissa Avila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-avila-05606799) and [Alan Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-m-lee). The robot freely tracks lines and interepret colored tiles along the drawn track as notes.

## RedBear: Motor, IR Sensors, and Potentiometer Control

A RedBear duo was responsible for controlling motor movement, line detection for the IR sensor, and control of the potentiometer (which was responsible for servo speed).

Code was complied in Particle Dev

## Adafruit Feather M4: Color Sensor, OLED Display, and Audio Breakout

The Adafruit Feather M4 interpreted colored note information from a color sensor and outputted note letters to an OLED display and note sound to an audio breakout board.

Code was complied in Arduino
